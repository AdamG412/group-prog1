HTML review
===========

1. Interest of content
----------------------

Excellent- text on the pages was quite brief but interesting, and includoing links to outside sources in some of the paragraphs was a good touch.

2. Consistency and quality of visual presentation
-------------------------------------------------

Excellent- colours were well chosen and the layout of text and images on the page made it easy to read and broke up the text. The two navbars on the information pages looked good and made the page accessible. 
Only faults are the main page seemed a bit empty and inconsistent with the rest of the site and one the Automation page the navbar wasn't padded and covered the title slightly. Also line spacing was quite large and could make
the page seem empty

3. Quality of written presentation
----------------------------------

Exemplary- spelling and grammar were all fine

4. Validity of HTML
-------------------

Good- 37 errors/warnings when put through HTML validator. Most are due to, in lists, the <a> tag coming before the <li> tag- <a> should be inside <li>. Also on Main and Automation there were <header> and <div> tags outside the 
<body>, and some IDs include whitespace when they should. However the site remains functional.

5.Evidence of collaboration
---------------------------

Good- contributions fairly equal from both authors and there is evidence they wrote each other's info. Some of the prject was finished quite last minute and a lot of the commit messages were unspecific- updated files were named
but what was changed was not actually noted
