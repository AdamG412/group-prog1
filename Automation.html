  <h1>Automation</h1>
    <p>Automation. In recent years, the idea has brought fear, worry and panic.Popular culture time and time again paints a dreary, dark image of the future in which Man is replaced by machine and left to be without use and powerless. However this hypothetical future isn't as realistic as one might think. Automation has the capacity to provide us with countless oportunities. In fact, automation is already around us and has been for longer than you'd think.</p>

  <h3>History</h3>
  <p>Automation is getting machines to do tasks that are tedious, difficult or even impossible for humans alone. The term automation was coined by the automobile industry in the 1940s to describe the rapidly increasing use of automatic devices on assembly lines.
  
  There are early uses of automation include the waterwheel developed in the 11th century to convert the kinnetic energy of falling or flowing water into a more useful to do tasks like milling. Other historical uses include the lathe, appearing as early as the 13th century BC with significants improvents to the design being made in the 18th century AD, and the rapid increase in automated factory production during World War 2.</p>

  <h3>Some Examples</h3>
  <p>Clearly, automation isn't just science fiction. It has been with us for millenia and is currently all around us, more than ever before. In our homes, on our streets, in factories and at work, it is inescapeable.
  
  Automation can be seen in "smart" homes with temperature sensors that are given control of heating or fridges that keep record of what's running out and orders the required groceries. There are also hoovers that are able to navigate around a house and find areas in need of cleaning and home security systems that notify the homeowner when someone approaches the door.
  
  From self-service checkouts in supermarkets to self driving cars many tasks are now being automated for the ease of mankind. Automated devices are used on factory assembley lines, in operating systems in computers to automatically repair broken files and in offices to do the job of a secretary.</p>
