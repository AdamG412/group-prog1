  <h1>Automation</h1>
    <p>Automation. In recent years, the idea has brought fear, worry and panic.Popular culture time and time again paints a dreary, dark image of the future in which Man is replaced by machine and left to be without use and powerless. However this hypothetical future isn't as realistic as one might think. Automation has the capacity to provide us with countless oportunities. In fact, automation is already around us and has been for longer than you'd think.</p>
